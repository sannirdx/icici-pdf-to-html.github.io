							<h2>Risks & Opportunities</h2>
							<p class="highlightedTxt">Regulatory compliance and alignment with emerging risk management practices are our
								key strategic imperatives. It forms a key element of our business. Managed acceptance of
								risk is essential to protect the stakeholders from potential risks and generate adequate
							shareholder value.</p>
							<div class="lineBg">
								<h3>RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK</h3>
								<p>Our risk management framework sets out the risks that we are prepared to accept, given the expected
									rewards and consistency with strategic objectives and those risks for which we have no tolerance and
									want to avoid. The framework is designed to support risk-based decision making and sets out limits and
								controls to ensure that our risk exposures remain within our risk appetite.</p>

							<div class="fullImg">
								<img src="images/graph1(1).svg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
							</div>
							<h4>RISK LANDSCAPE</h4>
							<p>The key risks that we are exposed to can be broadly categorised into the following:</p>
							<div class="blueBgList">
								<ol type="a">
									<li><span>Market Risk</span> The risk arising out of variations in the level or
										volatility of the market prices of assets, liabilities
										and financial instruments, including the risk arising
										from any mismatch between assets and liabilities,
									due to external market and economic factors.</li>
									<li><span>Credit Risk</span>The risk arising out of partial default, full default
									or delayed payments from counter-parties.</li>

									<li><span>Liquidity Risk</span>The risk that the Company, though solvent, either
										does not have sufficient financial resources to
										enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or
									can secure them only at excessive cost.</li>

									<li><span>Insurance Risk</span>The risk arising because of mis-estimation of the
										best estimate or because of random fluctuations
										in the frequency, size and timing of insurance
										liabilities. It includes mortality, morbidity and
									longevity risk, persistency risk and expense risk.</li>
								</ol>

								<ol class="rightOl">
									<li>

							<h4>MANAGING SUSTAINABILITY RISKS</h4>
							<p>Sustainability risks, particularly ESG (environmental,
								social and governance) related issues continue to
								increase in significance for the life insurance industry.
								Failure to mitigate climate change is widely being seen
								as the top long-term global risk facing the world today.
								For the life insurance industry, climate change could
								potentially have wide ranging implications including (but
								not limited to) adverse impact on economic growth and
								investment markets, higher than expected claims due to
								increased risk of future weather-related catastrophes,
								pandemics as well as possible changes in long-term
							mortality/morbidity rates.</p>
							<p>Apart from climate change, there are several other
								emerging risks associated with public health trends such
								as increase in obesity-related disorders and demographic
							changes such as population urbanisation and ageing</p>
							<p>Sustainability could also be impacted by issues related to
								customer experience, reputation, corporate governance,
							data security and privacy.</p>
							<p>We continue to work towards developing our
								understanding of ESG risks, including climate change and
								remain aware of industry best practices as they develop.
								The current industry consensus is for life insurance
								companies to treat climate risk as an amplifier of existing
								risks, rather than a new risk. Accordingly, sustainability
								risks including climate-related risks are integrated in
								our risk management framework and are a part of our
							Board-approved Risk Policy (“the Policy”).</p>
							<p>Our risk appetite statements as articulated in the Policy
								outline specific constraints that define the total level of
								risk that we are willing to accept. In particular, we have an appetite statement on customer risk and a framework
								to monitor outcome with the objective of taking actions to
								deliver positive outcome. Likewise, we have an appetite
								statement on reputation risk and a framework to monitor
							various factors that could impact our reputation.</p>
							<p>Our corporate governance framework is aligned to the
								regulatory guidelines on corporate governance. Our risk
								governance framework, which forms a part of the overall
								corporate governance framework, is detailed in the
								above Policy. In addition to the various risk management
								committees, the roles and responsibilities of which
								are specified in the Policy, we have an Executive ESG
								Committee comprising senior leaders which provide
								oversight on ESG-related policies and initiatives and
							monitor their implementation.</p>
							<p>Several other elements of our risk management
								framework are applicable for the management of
								sustainability risks as detailed in the Policy. In particular,
								we have a framework for information and cyber security
								as well as business continuity management to analyse
								emerging risks through regular monitoring of the external
								and internal environment. We have set out the technology
								modernisation, employee engagement approaches and
								process changes that are found to be effective for the
							rapidly changing environment.</p>
							<p>We have been accredited with ISO 22301:2019
								certification for Business Continuity Management
								processes and ISO 27001:2013 for Information Security
								Management Systems which provide additional level
								of assurance. We also have a privacy policy to ensure
								protection of sensitive personal data or information
								collected. Further information on our approach to
								sustainability risk management has been set out in the
								section on ‘Meeting challenges from sustainability risks’
								of the ESG report and ‘Enterprise Risk Management’ of
							the Annual Report. </p>
							<h4>RISK OUTLOOK</h4>
							<p>A detailed review of our risk exposures to market, credit,
								liquidity, insurance, operational, reputation and other
								emerging risks, as well as the key control processes is set
								out in the ‘Enterprise Risk Management’ section of this
								Report in page 172. Our risk assessment process is an
								ongoing analysis of our risk profile. Testing the resilience  of the balance sheet is an essential element of this
								process. It shows how our solvency position responds to
							different risk factors.</p>
							<p>Our solvency ratio improved during the year and stood
								strong at 208.9% at March 31, 2023, well above the
								regulatory requirement of 150%. With the proposed
								risk-based capital framework under discussion by IRDAI,
								our solvency ratio on an economic capital basis is also
								robust at 385% at December 31, 2022. We have been
								carrying out stress testing of the solvency position
								periodically during the year and these tests demonstrate
								that there is no capital requirement even in further
								stresses. Additionally, we continued to carry out reverse
								stress testing and liquidity stress testing exercises during
								the year and these also demonstrated our resilience to
							scenarios which are extreme, but plausible.</p>
							<p>During the year, we have reviewed our balance sheet
								exposure and taken actions to reduce the sensitivity to
								economic shocks, including placing hedges to further
								improve the resilience of our balance sheet. In addition
								to growth in non-linked savings products, there has
								been a strong growth in annuity products as well
								during the year. We use forward rate agreements to
								hedge the interest rate risk of our non-par guaranteed
								savings portfolio as well as the annuity portfolio.
								While COVID-19 related claims during the year were
								much lower, there has been a recent resurgence of
								COVID-19 infections in India and we shall continue to
							monitor our claims experience.</p>
							<p>While our solvency and liquidity positions continue
								to remain strong, there are challenges, particularly
								given the current geo-political environment, changes
								in tax regime and competitive landscape which could
								potentially impede our business growth and profitability
								and need to be monitored closely. We believe that a series
								of actions that we have taken in the recent past such
								as developing a comprehensive product suite to cater
								to all customer preferences, greater digital adoption,
								new partner acquisition and expanding our protection
								business will keep us well placed to manage some of
								these uncertainties. As we move forward, we continue
								to pursue a resilient, agile and growth-oriented strategy
								by offering suitable products and deploying appropriate
							risk management practices.</p>
							<h4>STRENGTHENING RISK MANAGEMENT</h4>

							<h4>STRENGTHENING OUR CYBER SECURITY</h4>
							<p>We plan to further strengthen our cyber security posture by ensuring key initiatives in areas listed below:</p>
							<div class="amibOx">
								<div class="amiIn">
									<img src="images/icon1a.svg" alt="">
									<p><span>People:</span> To help employees and

								</div>
								<div class="amiIn">
									<img src="images/icon2a.svg" alt="">
									<p><span>Technology:</span> To ensure
										sufficient capacity and solution
										deployment to mitigate/
									minimise cyber risk</p>
								</div>
								<div class="amiIn">
									<img src="images/icon3a.svg" alt="">
									<p><span>Processes:</span> To promote resilience,
										periodic drills for ensuring

								<div class="col-md-7">
									<h4>OPPORTUNITIES</h4>
									<p>Our financial strength, coupled with ongoing
										transformation, makes us resilient and allows us to profit
										from new opportunities in a fast-changing business
										environment. For example, by combining profound
										customer and market understanding and evolving
										data-analytics techniques, we are well positioned for
										growth and productivity gains. With a comprehensive
										product portfolio and a well-diversified distribution
										network, our key strategy is to capitalise the opportunities
										in the emerging environment, without comprising on our
									risk management approach.</p>
									<p>The mortality protection gap for India, which is high
										compared with the rest of the world, continues to
										provide significant opportunities for Indian life insurance
										companies to increase penetration of their protection
										business. Further, an ageing population and an increase
										in average life expectancy offers opportunities for life
										insurers to expand their annuity business. Given our wide
										distribution network and strong customer proposition, we
									are increasingly focussing on these product segments.</p>
									<p>The vision articulated by the regulator recently is that by
										the year 2047, the centenary year of India’s independence,
										every citizen should have a life cover, health cover and
										old-age security. Based on this vision, the regulatory
										authority has taken several measures with a clear focus
										on increasing insurance penetration in the country and
										facilitating ease of doing insurance business. We expect
										these measures to have a pronounced impact on the
									growth of the industry.</p>
									<p>For further details on opportunities envisaged by us,
										please refer to the section “Opportunities and Threats”
										under Management Discussion and Analysis in page 151
									of this report.</p>
